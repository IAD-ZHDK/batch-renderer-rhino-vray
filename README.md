# Rhino_Tool_Batch_Render
The tool was developed for Grimshaw Architects as a Tool to automate the rendering process. 

## How it works
It is an automation of the Rendering process in Rhino using VRay 3 as the default renderer. The Script will itterate through all the Named Views and all the Layer States. Every rendering is then saved in the specified folder together with the pre-selected passes. The naming of the file then contains the LayerState and the Named View

## Short Info
The code is written in Python using the RhinoScript library and the VRay 3 API.
